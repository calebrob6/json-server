Simplexity Protocol (in development):

URL PATH:	/connect
Arguments:	<none>
Returns:	{"ID":<your id>,"AUTH":<your authentication integer>,"GAMEID":<your gameID>}

This command is what the client must call in order to join a game. This command will block until a game is found (2 players are ready) or the connection times out
(however long that is). The server will then return a JSON data structure with the client's id, authentication number, and game id. These values will need to be passed
to all subsequent API calls so that the server can recognize who is who.

URL PATH:	/game/status
Arguments:	{"ID":<your id>,"AUTH":<your authentication integer>,"GAMEID":<your gameID>}
Returns:	{"TURN":<id of whose turn it is>,"BOARD":<Array[WIDTH][LENGTH] of the game state>,"RUNNING":<boolean that says whether the game is running>} or null if there is an error

This command takes the standard user id, auth, and game id integers as input and returns a JSON object that contains the ID of whose turn it is as well as a 2-dimensional
array of the board state.

URL PATH:	/game/move
Arguments:	{"ID":<your id>,"AUTH":<your authentication integer>,"GAMEID":<your gameID>,
---------:	"COMMAND":["MOVE",<column #>,<piece type>]}
Returns:	{"WON":<boolean>,"ERROR":<#>}

The move command again takes the client's user id, auth, and game id along with a "COMMAND" parameter which is an array where the first value is a string containing the
command name and the subsequent indexes containing arguments to pass to that command.

The only command implemented in Simplexity is "MOVE" which takes the arguments: column # and type of piece (where 1 is the square piece and 2 is the circle piece)

The return values are WON which is a boolean value saying if your move resulted in you winning and ERROR which is an integer that means one of the following:

ERROR Values and Meaning:
-1	Unspecified error
0	All is good
1	It isn't your turn to move
2	Error placing piece
3	Malformed JSON input
4	Your userID and auth aren't right
